# TranslateEasy
Application to aid with translation work (Englisch to German)


The application first lets you choose a text file, which should countain text in English language.
The chosen text will then be devided into its single sentences.
In the main window each sentence will be presented sequentially with a corresponding German translation using Google Translate.
You can keep the translation offered by the programm or make alterations to it to create your own translation.
On saving your progress the first time, a new file will be created that contains your translation of the original text
(up to the sentence where you saved or ended the programm). If you saved the text before, the translation file will be updated.
